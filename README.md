# Deadlock Lab Simulation

This repository contains all the necessary files and information related to the laboratory work on deadlock simulation. 
The project demonstrates a practical implementation of the dining philosophers problem, highlighting deadlock and resource contention scenarios.

## ðŸ“‹ Contents

- **[`deadlock_lab_essentials_and_important.pdf`](deadlock_lab_essentials_and_important.pdf):** A comprehensive step-by-step guide on how the laboratory work was performed, including the tools used.
- **[`results.txt`](results.txt):** Contains the output of the program, including the results of deadlock simulation.

## ðŸ›  Tools and Technologies

- **Docker:** Used to create an isolated environment for the project.
- **Ubuntu:** Operating system within the Docker container.
- **Java:** Language used to implement the deadlock simulation.
- **XQuartz:** Facilitates graphical display for X11 applications (e.g., xeyes).
- **Git:** For version control and repository management.
- **Nano:** Text editor used for modifying the Java code.

## ðŸš€ How to Run
